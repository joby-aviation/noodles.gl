            ## Automated Project File Migration

            This PR contains automated migrations of project files in `animations/timeline-editor/public/noodles/` after detecting new migration files in the codebase.

            ### Changes
            - Applied latest schema migrations to project files
            - Updated file versions to match current schema

            ### Review Notes
            - Please review the changes to ensure project files were migrated correctly
            - Test that existing projects still load and function properly
            - Merge this PR to apply the migrations to the main branch
