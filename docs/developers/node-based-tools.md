# Node-based tools

Noodles draws inspiration from a long line of node-based tools and workflow builders.

Specifically it aims to follow in the footsteps of [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) and [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/), two graphical programming environments commonly used in hollywood special effects and live performances.

The principle that everything is a value, and all values are reactive makes creating visuals intuitive, flexible, and repeatable. Noodles attempts to simplify the visualization creation process while exposing powerful primitives and a flexible IDE.

Some other prior art:

* [** Kepler.gl **](https://kepler.gl/) - Amazing tool for creating beautiful maps in Deck.gl. Aimed at being easy to get up and running
* [Blender Geometry Nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html) - Procedural animation in the Blender project. General purpose 3D tool (also used in the shader editor and compositor).
* [Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/) - Procedural motion graphics and animation

Other node-based tools to check out:

* [N8N](https://n8n.io/) - workflow builder for creating agentic workflows.
* [ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) - node-based tool for creating diffusion images. Large community of shared workflows and operators
* [Count](https://count.co/) - Node-based data tool for reactive data programming, emphasis on data tables and data provenance
* [Observable Canvases](https://observablehq.com/platform/canvases) - each node acts as both input and output with custom UI. Aimed at repeatability and interactive dashboarding
* [Unreal Blueprints](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine) - Visual scripting for logic in a video game editor
