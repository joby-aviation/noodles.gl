# Node-based tools

Noodles draws inspiration from a long line of node-based tools and workflow builders.

Specifically it aims to follow in the footsteps of [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/) and [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/), two graphical programming environments commonly used in hollywood special effects and live performances.

The principle that everything is a value, and all values are reactive makes creating visuals intuitive, flexible, and repeatable. Noodles attempts to simplify the visualization creation process while exposing powerful primitives and a flexible IDE.

Some other prior art:

* [**Kepler.gl**](https://kepler.gl/) - Amazing tool for creating beautiful maps in Deck.gl. Aimed at being easy to get up and running
* [**Blender Geometry Nodes**](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html) - Procedural animation in the Blender project. General purpose 3D tool (also used in the shader editor and compositor).
* [**Cavalry**](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co/) - Procedural motion graphics and animation
